## Photography Now!!

### Project inspiration
Most are the times one needs to get a professional photographer to cover their event but it always prooves to be a hustle before you get one who will satisfy your needs.
PhotoHub offers an all photographers and their various works under one roof.
For a start we have limited categories ranging from: Brithday shoots, Weddings, proffessional shoots, animal photography, Product photography etc.

# Front-End
We the PhotoHub developers used HTML and CSS to create and style the front end of the website with the files being static.

# Back-End
We used Python to create users ie the client and the photographer.
Created sessions for them.
The user provides their preffered username, their email address,and a password.

# Storage
For storage we used MySQL to create the database and schemas involved for the photographer.
We hashed the passwords before storage to beef up security of the passwords.
